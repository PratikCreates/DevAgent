# 🕵️ DevAgent - Demystify any codebase you like

**Built for TiDB AgentX Hackathon 2025: Forge Agentic AI for Real-World Impact**

DevAgent transforms any GitHub repository into an interactive AI assistant. Instead of navigating thousands of files, simply provide a repository URL and start asking questions about code architecture, security vulnerabilities, deployment strategies, and implementation details.

DevAgent combines TiDB's distributed vector database for lightning-fast semantic code search with Kimi LLM's web search capabilities to provide both deep code analysis and up-to-date deployment insights. Common questions are cached for sub-100ms responses, while complex queries leverage real-time web search.

# 🚀 Quick Setup

## Prerequisites
- **TiDB Account** – free tier available at [tidbcloud.com](https://tidbcloud.com)  
- **Kimi API Key** – get yours at [moonshot.cn](https://www.moonshot.ai/)  
- **Modal Account** – serverless compute at [modal.com](https://modal.com)  

## Installation & Deployment
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devagent.git
    cd devagent
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Configure environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit `.env` with your credentials:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL=your_tidb_connection_string
    KIMI_API_KEY=your_kimi_api_key
    ```

3. Deploy backend and run frontend:
    - Setup Modal secrets:
        ```bash
        modal secret create tidb-secret DATABASE_URL=your_tidb_url
        modal secret create kimi-secret KIMI_API_KEY=your_kimi_key
        ```
    - Deploy serverless backend:
        ```bash
        modal deploy agent_core.py
        ```
    - Run Streamlit frontend:
        ```bash
        streamlit run app.py
        ```

The system automatically handles repository ingestion, vector embedding, and intelligent caching. Visit the Streamlit URL to start analyzing repositories with AI.
